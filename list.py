'''data types - int (number), string(str), boolean(bool) -- stores single value
aprat from this we have some other datatypes
sequence / mapping datatypes -- which stores more than one value at a time this both is knows as iterables
sewuence data type -- list, str, tuples (str will store only one value remainig will store more then one value )
mapping data types -- dict --
list is of 2 types homogenous and heterogenous list
homogenous list contains only single data type ie: str or int [1,1,2,2] ["srr","eeje"]
heterogenous list contains all data types ie: str,int,boolean [1,"sss",22,33,33,"se",true]
list are muteable means we can change the list but in str we cannot changed str is immuteable 
when we add two arrays into one array this process is called concadination'''
